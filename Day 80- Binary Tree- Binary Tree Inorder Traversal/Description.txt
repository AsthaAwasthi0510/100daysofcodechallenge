ðŸ“ŒSub-topic: Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
ðŸ“ŒLanguage used:Java
ðŸ“ŒQuestion: 
ðŸ“ŒGithub link: 

ðŸ“ŒExplanation:

Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.
 
ðŸ“ŒTest Cases:

Test Case 1:

Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]

Test Case 2:
Input: root = []
Output: []

Test Case 3:
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]

ðŸ“ŒIntuition
In a binary tree inorder traversal, the left subtree is visited first, followed by the root node and then the right subtree. This traversal method is also known as a depth-first search.

Approach
The order of visiting the nodes in an inorder traversal is: left child, root, right child.
