In this program, we need to calculate the sum of nodes present in the binary tree. First, we will traverse through the left sub-tree and calculate the sum of nodes present in 
the left sub-tree. Similarly, we calculate the sum of nodes present in the right sub-tree and calculate total sum by adding the roots data.
                        
                              5
                            /   \
                          2       9
                         /      /   \
                        1      8     6 
 For the given tree, sum of nodes of the binary tree will be 1 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 6 + 9 = 31.
