TOPIC: SORTING
SUBTOPIC: SORT COLORS
LANGUAGE USED: JAVA

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue. We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

TEST CASES:
TEST CASE 1:
• Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
• Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

TEST CASE 2:
• Input: nums = [2,0,1]
• Output: [0,1,2]

CONSTRAINTS:
• n == nums.length
• 1 <= n <= 300
• nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.
