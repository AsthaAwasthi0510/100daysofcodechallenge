📌 TOPIC: SORTING
📌 SUB TOPIC: INTERSECTION OF TWO ARRAYS
📌 LANGUAGE USED: JAVA

Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be unique and you may return the result in any order.

📌 TEST CASES
📍 TEST CASE 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2]

📍 TEST CASE 2:
• Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
• Output: [9,4]
• Explanation: [4,9] is also accepted.

📌 CONSTRAINTS
• 1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000
• 0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000

📌 The intitution is 
1. sort both the array 
2.here we will use two pointer to check element from both the array 
as both the array are sorted so we will adjust the array index by comparing the array values
