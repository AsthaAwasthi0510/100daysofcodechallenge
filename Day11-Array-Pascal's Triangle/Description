Sub Topic: Pascal's Triangle

One of the most interesting Number Patterns is Pascal's Triangle (named after Blaise Pascal, a famous French Mathematician and Philosopher).
To build the triangle, start with "1" at the top, then continue placing numbers below it in a triangular pattern.
Each number is the numbers directly above it added together.

Patterns Within the Triangle
***Diagonals***
- The first diagonal is, of course, just "1"s
- The next diagonal has the Counting Numbers (1,2,3, etc).
- The third diagonal has the triangular numbers

***Symmetrical***
The triangle is also symmetrical. The numbers on the left side have identical matching numbers on the right side, like a mirror image.

***Horizontal Sums***
What do you notice about the horizontal sums?
Is there a pattern?
They double each time (powers of 2).
