TOPIC: STRINGS
SUBTOPIC: LONGEST COMMON PREFIX

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

***TEST CASES***

TEST CASE 1:
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"

TEST CASE 2:
Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

***CONSTRAINTS***
1 <= strs.length <= 200
0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.

***EXPLAINATION***
We can compare the strings and just find if there is any common prefix in it or not.
