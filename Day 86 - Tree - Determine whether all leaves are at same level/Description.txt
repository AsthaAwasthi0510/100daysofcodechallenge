In this program, we need to check whether all the leaves of the given binary tree are at same level or not.

A Node is said to be leaf if it doesn't have any child node. In the below diagram, nodes 4, 5 and 6 are leaf nodes as they don't have any child node. 
Nodes 4, 5 and 6 are present at the same level, i.e., Level 2.
