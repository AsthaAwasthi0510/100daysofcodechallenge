TOPIC: STRINGS
SUBTOPIC: FINDING THE INDEX OF FIRST OCCURRENCE IN A STRING
LANGUAGE USED: JAVA

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

***TEST CASES***
TEST CASE 1:
Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

TEST CASE 2:
Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
 
***CONSTRAINTS***

1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 10^4
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.
