SUB TOPIC: VALID PALINDROME
LANGUAGE USED: JAVA
APPROACH USED: TWO POINTER APPROACH

A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. 
Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.
Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

***TEST CASES***

TEST CASE 1:
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.

TEST CASE 2:
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.

TEST CASE 3:
Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.

***Constraints***

1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105
s consists only of printable ASCII characters.
