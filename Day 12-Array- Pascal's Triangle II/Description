Given an integer rowIndex, return the rowIndexth (0-indexed) row of the Pascal's triangle. 
In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown in the file uploaded in this section:

Test Case 1:

Input: rowIndex = 3
Output: [1,3,3,1]

Test Case 2:
Input: rowIndex = 0
Output: [1]

Constraints:
0 <= rowIndex <= 33

For this you must see the other folder that has the explaination of this Pascal's Triangle.
It needs the same approach , only we can print the row index
