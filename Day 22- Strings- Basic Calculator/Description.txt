TOPIC: STRINGS
SUBTOPIC: BASIC CALCULATOR
LANGUAGE USED: JAVA

Given a string s representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.
Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().

***TEST CASES***

TEST CASE 1:
Input: s = "1 + 1"
Output: 2

TEST CASE 2:
Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
Output: 3

TEST CASE 3:
Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
Output: 23

***CONSTRAINTS***

1 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^5
s consists of digits, '+', '-', '(', ')', and ' '.
s represents a valid expression.
'+' is not used as a unary operation (i.e., "+1" and "+(2 + 3)" is invalid).
'-' could be used as a unary operation (i.e., "-1" and "-(2 + 3)" is valid).
There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.

SOLUTION APPROACH:
We will use iterative approach in this.
